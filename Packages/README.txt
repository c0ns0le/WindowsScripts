To successfully run the scripts in the folder in the intended order, right click the "SetExecutionPolicy.bat" script and click "Run As Administrator".

In order to set the Execution Policy of Powershell, the user needs to run the command in an elevated console.

The Setup.bat script will set the execution policy, and then you (the user) must open an Administrator PowerShell session and begin running the NewInstall.ps1 script.
